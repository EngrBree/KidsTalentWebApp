<h1>Why nurture Kids talents</h1>
<p>Talents do not always have to be passed down through generations ;your child might be the first in the family to draw or paint well or the only one who has an interest in musical instruments. Whether you’ve discovered your child’s talent at home or through his/her preschool teacher’s feedback, it is important to know that talent comes in many forms and is best encouraged and nurtured from a young age.
Helping children to discover their talents, and providing adequate training, builds their confidence and is essential to their future success. It is then up to parents to recognise their child’s ability and take action to nurture it. 
If you aspire for your child to enhance their talent, you need to be their biggest supporter as well as their toughest critic. To put it simply, your constant support can go far in developing their talents and encouraging them to aim high.
Children are inquisitive by nature, and they are always eager to explore and learn new things. One good sign to look out for is your child’s attention and focus on a particular activity. A child with a particular talent in an area is able to sustain their interest better for a longer period. Unstructured play is the best time to observe your child
